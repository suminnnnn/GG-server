## ✍🏻 Description

   Despite considerable efforts, the severity of global warming has led to an ongoing increase in endangered species.<br/> However, people remain unaware of which animals are facing extinction.<br/> To address this issue, we conducted a project based on information about endangered animals.<br/> Our project was based on Life on Land with the intention of promoting endangered animals. We provide the most appropriate endangered animal card through four questions, which can be found on MyPage.

   The GroundGuardians project is dedicated to raising awareness of ongoing environmental destruction and the crisis of animal extinction.<br/> Our team, One Peace believe that only through our collective efforts and concern can peace and balance be restored to the Earth.<br/> Our goal is to spread awareness of issues threatening the planer, fostering a shared commitment to drive positive change.<br/> Let's work together to safeguard the Earth and build a peaceful future.
